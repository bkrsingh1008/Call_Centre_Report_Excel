# Call_Centre_Report_Excel

Project Description:
--------------------
In this project, I analyzed a large dataset of call center records from 2023 and 2024. The dataset included key metrics such as call duration, customer satisfaction ratings, representative performance, and customer informations such as customer gender, which city they belong to, and their age. I leveraged Excel to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

Tools Used:
-----------
1. Pivot Tables
2. Power Pivot
3. Slicers
4. Conditional Formatting
5. DAX
6. Interactive Charts

Key Learnings:
--------------
1. Combined datasets, including calculated fields like fiscal year (FY), call day of the week, and call duration buckets, to build an interactive data model.
2. Created fully interactive dashboards that allow users to filter by fiscal year, and customer demographics, and provide insights dynamic and easy to navigate.
3. Used bar charts, column charts, line charts and slicers to display key trends like monthly call performance by representative, average customer satisfaction by demographic.
4. Used Conditional formatting (data baars) to highlighted areas of concern to make the data more actionable.
5. Created custom calculations to derive insights like average satisfaction ratings and day of week and satisfaction rating.

Key Insights:
-------------
1. Total Calls: The analysis includes the total number of calls received by the call center, providing a clear picture of overall volume and workload.

2. Total Purchase Amount: By analyzing the data, I calculated the total purchase amount made by customers through call interactions.

3. Total Call Duration: The total time spent on calls was analyzed, helping to evaluate the efficiency and resource allocation within the call center.

4. Average Satisfaction Rating: The average customer satisfaction rating across all calls was calculated, providing a key indicator of overall service quality.

5. 5-Star Ratings: I identified the number of calls that received 5-star rating, giving insights into the highest level of customer satisfaction.

6. Monthly Call Trends: Analyzed the monthly trends in call volume to detect seasonal patterns or fluctuations, helping to forecast resource needs. Call volumes peaked in April and October, indicating periods of high activity.

7. Gender Distribution Across Cities: Found insights into the number of male and female callers within different cities, which helps understand the demographic breakdown of customer interactions.

8. Calls by Representative: Evaluated how many calls each representative handled, identifying top performers across the team.
