# Call_Centre_Report_Excel

Project Description:
--------------------
In this project, I analyzed a large dataset of call center records from 2023 and 2024. The dataset included key metrics such as call duration, customer satisfaction ratings, representative performance, and customer informations such as customer gender, which city they belong to, and their age. I leveraged Excel to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

Tools Used:
-----------
1. Pivot Tables
2. Power Pivot
3. Slicers
4. Conditional Formatting
5. DAX
6. Interactive Charts

Key Learnings:
--------------
1. Combined datasets, including calculated fields like fiscal year (FY), call day of the week, and call duration buckets, to build an interactive data model.
2. Created fully interactive dashboards that allow users to filter by fiscal year, and customer demographics, and provide insights dynamic and easy to navigate.
3. Used bar charts, column charts, line charts and slicers to display key trends like monthly call performance by representative, average customer satisfaction by demographic.
4. Used Conditional formatting (data baars) to highlighted areas of concern to make the data more actionable.
5. Created custom calculations to derive insights like average satisfaction ratings and day of week and satisfaction rating.
